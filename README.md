# B2Space Systems

## Site Purpose
This site is created and maintained by an aspiring rocket engineering college student to further understanding of myself in the field of rocketry, space systems and orbital mechanics as well as share the knowledge that I have picked up with you guys!

## Focus
I will primarily be focussing on rocket simulations and course material that I have learned at university by applying practical visualisation to mathematical concepts. On top of that, I will also record personal and university projects that are not Space related.
