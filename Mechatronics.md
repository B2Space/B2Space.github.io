# Mechatronics Projects


## University Projects
As a mechatronics engineering student, I aim to document my projects and learnings on this page along with my hobby of space engineering.


### Robot Kinematics
This project involves designing a 2DOF robotic arm which can move in 2D space. It can be operated either using Forward Kinematics - where desired angles are input and the positions are calculated. Or by Inverse Kinematics - where the desired positions are input and the joint angles are calculated. 

For a 2DOF robot, it is easy to derive the equations of motion using trigonometry to create a relationship between joint lenghts and joint angles.
