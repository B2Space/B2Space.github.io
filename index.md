### <p align="center">Site Purpose</p>
This site is created and maintained by an aspiring rocket engineering college student to further understanding of myself in the field of rocketry, space systems and orbital mechanics as well as share the knowledge that I have picked up with you guys!

### <p align="center">Focus Topics</p>
I will primarily be focussing on rocket simulations, advancements in rocket theory and data collection of previous launches. Although NASA and ESA have good data coverage and exposure, I will be diving more into [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) and their technologies.
