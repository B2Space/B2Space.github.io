# Home Page

### Site Purpose
This site is created and maintained by a mechatronics college student inspired by BPS.Space to further my understanding in the field of rocketry, space systems and orbital mechanics as well as share the knowledge that I have picked up with you guys!

### Development so far
I have created very rudimentary simulations that use basic kinematics, kinetics and coding so far with the future goal of creating a fully simulated 3D rocket launch one day.


### Simulations
The current simulations I have done so far can be found [here](./Simulations.html) and will be updated everytime I create, revise one.

### University Projects
As I am actually Mechatronics student in college, I aim to use this site as a way to document the projects I have done over the years. It is of no relaiton to the rocketry component of this page but if you are interested, they can be found [here](./Mechatronics.html).
