# Home Page

### Site Purpose
This site is created and maintained by an aspiring rocket engineering college student to further my understanding in the field of rocketry, space systems and orbital mechanics as well as share the knowledge that I have picked up with you guys!

### Development so far
I have created very rudimentary simulations that use basic kinematics, kinetics and coding so far with the future goal of creating a fully simulated 3D rocket launch one day.


### Simulations
The current simulations I have done so far can be found [here](./Simulations.html) and will be updated everytime I create, revise one.
